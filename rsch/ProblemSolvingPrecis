Human problem solving
a. Examples/conceptual models
    1)  Cryptoquip puzzles
    2)  Medical diagnosis
    3)  Other?

b.  Multicyclic nature
    1)  Most LIDA research so far has focused on single cycle processes. IDA is the only exception and it is 15 years old.
    2)  Complex problem solving as well as action selection in a complex, dangerous, changing environment require constant sensorimotor
        activity with highly active cognition making decisions constantly and continually. The LIDA Model terms this multicyclic
        cognition.
    3)  Multicyclic cognition relies on
        A.  Construction of workspace structures by structure building codelets in a profligate manner. The structures are termed
            "cognitive content" and form the basis of any way in which perception, memory and understanding can influence action selection.
        B.  Attentional selection of profligately constructed content by attention codelets, determining at each instant a tiny subset of
            the possible content that will be broadcast to the entire system to effect action selection and learning.
        C.  The preservation, accumulation, and refinement of structures over multiple action-selection + perception-understanding-     
            attention cycles. This results in a refinement of the current situational model which allows for increasingly appropriate
            action selection. In the case of a puzzle, effective multicyclic cognition will lead to a trial solution and eventually, a 
            correction solution to the puzzle.
            
 c. First steps
    1)  Before we can assemble a multicyclic process, we must develop 
        A.  (Human-like) strategies for selecting actions that may lead to a solution
        B.
